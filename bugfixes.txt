# AlphaZero Implementation Bug Fixes

## C++ MCTS Implementation Fixes

1. Improved hashing method in transposition table to reduce collision risk
   - Replaced std::hash<std::string> with FNV-1a hash algorithm for better distribution and fewer collisions

2. Fixed uninitialized terminal state variable in mcts.cpp
   - Added proper initialization and documentation for the is_terminal flag

3. Added bounds checking for progressive widening
   - Ensured width calculation doesn't exceed move_priors.size() to prevent out-of-bounds access

4. Implemented a non-recursive approach for count_nodes
   - Replaced recursive implementation with iterative stack-based approach to avoid deadlocks with locks

5. Fixed a potential null pointer dereference in transposition table
   - Added proper check before accessing lru_map_ in lookup method

6. Enhanced random eviction strategy in the transposition table when full
   - Added proper eviction logic instead of silently failing

7. Improved the backup method to use an iterative approach instead of recursion
   - Prevents potential stack overflow and deadlocks in deep trees

8. Fixed selection bias in select_child by randomizing when scores are equal
   - Added randomization among top-scoring children instead of always taking the first one

## Python MCTS Implementation Fixes

1. Fixed MCTSNode.backup to use an iterative approach instead of recursion
   - Prevents potential stack overflow in deep trees and improves performance

2. Fixed negative temperature handling in _get_search_probabilities
   - Added proper absolute value handling and log-domain calculations for numerical stability

3. Added probability normalization for move selection
   - Ensures probabilities sum to 1 to prevent np.random.choice from failing

4. Enhanced error handling in CppMCTSWrapper
   - Added detailed validation and better error messages
   - Implemented retry logic for update_with_move failures

5. Fixed the division by zero issue in enhanced_mcts.py RAVE calculation
   - Added proper denominator handling and safety checks

6. Fixed memory leak in executor handling in enhanced_mcts.py
   - Used context manager to ensure proper cleanup of thread pools

7. Improved efficiency of transposition table hashing
   - Replaced inefficient string conversion with direct numerical hashing

8. Fixed race condition in backup() in enhanced_mcts.py
   - Implemented proper locking mechanism for thread safety

## Training Infrastructure Fixes

1. Fixed add_values method in self_play.py
   - Fixed value array initialization to ensure consistent length with states
   - Added validation to catch inconsistencies

2. Improved multiprocessing pool management in generate_games
   - Added proper error handling and fallback to sequential mode
   - Implemented timeout mechanism to prevent hanging

3. Enhanced checkpoint loading with comprehensive error handling
   - Added file existence checks, proper key validation, and device mapping
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for error recovery

4. Added validation and early stopping to the training pipeline
   - Implemented patience-based early stopping
   - Added tracking of best model and automatic saving

5. Fixed policy loss calculation with proper shape validation
   - Added handling for dimension mismatches and validation of input data

6. Enhanced save_checkpoint method
   - Added support for custom filenames
   - Implemented error recovery and alternative save paths

7. Added evaluation mode support to the trainer
   - Separated training and validation code paths
   - Used torch.set_grad_enabled for proper gradient handling

8. Fixed board size calculation issue in trainer.py
   - Added validation for non-square boards and proper fallback

These fixes address all major bugs and issues identified in the codebase, including memory management issues, thread safety problems, numerical stability concerns, and error handling gaps.
